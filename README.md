# How many gateways can be powered by the same pylon in Starcraft2?

Turns out the answer is X.

# Background

Starcraft 2 is a Real-time strategy game from 2010. Players try to win by constructing production buildings and an army.
The game arena can be - for construction purposes - thought of as two-dimensional grid of discrete cells. Buildings must be placed exactly on these cells. Buildings are either of size 2x2, 3x3 or 4x4 cells.

One of the races called Protoss need to construct their buildings within a power field of another building, called a Pylon (a 2x2 building).
